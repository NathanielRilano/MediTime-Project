<h1><font color=blue><b></b>MEDITIME "YOUR HEALTH VISIT SCHEDULER"<h1></h1><br>
<br><h2><b>Project Description</h2><br></b>
<center><h4>The Medime System for Barangay Talumpok is a comprehensive healthcare management platform designed specifically for the needs of the community within Barangay Talumpok. This system serves as a centralized hub for organizing, monitoring, and enhancing healthcare services within the barangay, aiming to improve the overall well-being of its residents.</h></center> <br><br>
<h1>Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well being <br></h1>
MediTime’s intended impact is in harmony with Sustainable Development Goal 3, 
emphasizing the importance of averting potential diseases among the residents of Barangay 
Talumpok, Batangas City. This involves promoting healthy lives by implementing a wellorganized schedule of appointments for regular check-ups and providing complimentary 
vaccinations across all age groups. The aim is to proactively address health concerns and 
enhance the well-being of the community. By enhancing the quality of services provided by 
MediTime to community health facilities, it becomes feasible to reduce potential disease rates. 
This improvement facilitates the promotion of preventive measures, early detection, and timely 
interventions, thereby contributing significantly to the overall reduction of health-related risks 
within the community.<br>
<br>Objectives of the Project<br>
Implementing a medical scheduling system for vaccination comes with specific objectives aimed 
at ensuring a smooth and efficient process for both healthcare providers.<br>
1. Minimize Wait Times:<br>
• To efficiently schedule and manage appointments for healthcare providers in 
Barangay Talumpok Silangan.<br>
• Reduce patient wait times by implementing an optimized scheduling system that 
minimizes overbooking and ensures a steady flow of patients throughout the 
vaccination clinic.<br>
2. User-friendly Patient Interface:<br>
• Develop a user-friendly interface for patients to easily schedule, reschedule, or 
cancel vaccination appointments. Consider incorporating multiple communication 
channels, such as online portals, mobile apps, and phone services.<br>
3. Flexible Scheduling Options:<br>
• To allow patients to create accounts with their personal information, appointment 
slots and to identify if they are a citizen of Talumpok Silangan<br>
• Objective: Provide flexibility in scheduling options, allowing individuals to 
choose convenient time slots while ensuring that the scheduling system remains 
adaptable to changes in vaccine availability<br>
